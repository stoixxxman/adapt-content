1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Look at that.
Another new coffee shop.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,910
- You see that?
- Totally. Yeah.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,840
- What's that one called?
- Foam Party.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,580
"Foam Party"? Come on.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,950
And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that?

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,110
I see it.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,620
Is that a coffee shop
or a disco?

8
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,320
Dad, you're old, man.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,120
<i>There are multiple reports</i>

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,020
<i>of another mysterious
seismic event last night.</i>

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,990
<i>Sources close to Spider-Man say
he's looking into the problem.</i>

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,460
Spider-Man. I mean,
this guy swings in once a day,

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,900
zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,060
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,570
Meanwhile,
my guys are out there,

16
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,000
- lives on the line, no masks.
- Uh-huh.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,970
- We show our faces.
- Speed up. I know these kids.

18
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,970
With great ability
comes great accountability.

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,570
That's not even
how the saying goes.

20
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,110
I do like his cereal, though.
I'll give him that.

21
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,380
Oh, my gosh.
Don't cops run red lights?

22
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,210
Oh, yeah, some do.
But not your dad.

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,220
<i>♪ My memories keep begging ♪</i>

24
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,450
<i>♪ For someone else ♪</i>

25
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,160
<i>♪ I know this feeling, yes
I know it very well ♪</i>

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,230
Why can't I go back
to Brooklyn Middle?

27
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,630
You've given it
two weeks.

28
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,400
We're not having
this conversation.

29
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,600
I just think that
this new school is elitist.

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,200
- "Elitist"?
- And I would prefer to be

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,000
at a normal school
among the people.

32
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,940
"The people"?
These are your people.

33
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,380
I'm only here 'cause
I won that stupid lottery.

34
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,110
No way. You passed the entry
test just like everybody else.

35
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,680
You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that?

36
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,380
You wanna end up
like your uncle?

37
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,450
What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.

38
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,020
We all make choices in life.

39
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,550
It doesn't feel
like I have a choice right now.

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,990
You don't!

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,570
I love you, Miles.

42
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,480
Yeah, I know, Dad.
See you Friday.

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,210
- You gotta say "I love you" back.
- Dad, are you serious?

44
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,350
I wanna hear it.
"I love you, Dad."

45
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,020
You wanna hear me
say it?

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,380
You're dropping me off
at a school.

47
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,580
- "I love you, Dad."
- Look at this place.

48
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,590
"Dad, I love you."

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,330
Dad, I love you.

50
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,550
That's a copy.
