Computer programming is the process of telling a computer to do certain things by giving it instructions. These instructions are called programs. A person who writes instructions is a computer programmer. The instructions come in different languages; they are called programming languages. Many programming languages exist. Sometimes programmers use special software, such as integrated development environments (IDEs), which have many features, including a text editor, to help them to type and edit programs.

Computers themselves understand instructions directly when those instructions are written in machine code, special sequences of characters that are able to be processed by the computer but are difficult to read by humans. Writing these instructions directly in machine code is tedious and difficult, so instructions are written in a language easier for people to use, which the computer converts into "computer form" instructions (in other words, machine code) so the computer can follow them. The simplest of these are assembly language. Programs written in a language more like English is converted by a compiler. Some languages, called interpreted languages, use interpreters instead of assemblers or compilers.
