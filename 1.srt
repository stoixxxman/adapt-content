1
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,276
Chris Anderson: So Robert
spent the last few years

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,636
think about how weird human behavior is,

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,876
and how inadequate most
of our language trying to explain it is.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,276
And it's very exciting to hear him
explain some of the thinking behind it

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,956
in public for the first time.

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,076
Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,060
(Applause)

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,476
Robert Sapolsky: Thank you.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,980
The fantasy always runs
something like this.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,956
I've overpowered his elite guard,

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,915
burst into his secret bunker

12
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,756
with my machine gun ready.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,676
He lunges for his Luger.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,516
I knock it out of his hand.

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,876
He lunges for his cyanide pill.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,636
I knock that out of his hand.

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,956
He snarls,

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,196
comes at me with otherworldly strength.

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,916
We grapple, we fight,

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,836
I manage to pin him down

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,420
and put on handcuffs.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,316
"Adolf Hitler," I say,

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,180
"I arrest you for crimes
against humanity."

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,796
Here's where the Medal of Honor
version of the fantasy ends

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,676
and the imagery darkens.

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,419
What would I do if I had Hitler?

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,740
It's not hard to imagine
once I allow myself.

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,676
Sever his spine at the neck.

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,076
Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument.

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,876
Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,036
Leave him alive on a respirator,

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,356
tube-fed, not able to speak
or move or see or hear, just to feel,

33
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,636
and then inject him
with something cancerous

34
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,916
that's going to fester and pustulate

35
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,876
until every cell in his body
is screaming in agony,

36
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,140
until every second
feels like an eternity in hell.

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,340
That's what I would do to Hitler.

38
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,756
I've had this fantasy since I was a kid,

39
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,276
still do sometimes,

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,956
and when I do, my heart speeds up --

41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,860
all these plans for the most evil,
wicked soul in history.

42
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,916
But there's a problem,

43
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,836
which is I don't actually believe
in souls or evil,

44
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,396
and I think wicked belongs in a musical.

45
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,836
But there's some people
I would like to see killed,

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,676
but I'm against the death penalty.

47
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,796
But I like schlocky violent movies,

48
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,596
but I'm for strict gun control.

49
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,676
But then there was a time
I was at a laser tag place,

50
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,580
and I had such a good time
hiding in a corner shooting at people.

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,980
In other words, I'm your basic
confused human when it comes to violence.

52
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,916
Now, as a species, we obviously
have problems with violence.

53
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,996
We use shower heads to deliver poison gas,

54
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,116
letters with anthrax,
airplanes as weapons,

55
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,996
mass rape as a military strategy.

56
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,300
We're a miserably violent species.

57
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,236
But there's a complication,

58
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,636
which is we don't hate violence,

59
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,516
we hate the wrong kind.

60
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,996
And when it's the right kind,

61
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,516
we cheer it on, we hand out medals,

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,676
we vote for, we mate with
our champions of it.

63
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,516
When it's the right kind of violence,

64
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,740
we love it.

65
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,996
And there's another complication,

66
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,076
which is, in addition to us
being this miserably violent species,

67
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,900
we're also this extraordinarily
altruistic, compassionate one.

68
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,636
So how do you make sense
of the biology of our best behaviors,

69
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,676
our worst ones and all of those
ambiguously in between?

70
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,956
Now, for starters,

71
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,276
what's totally boring is understanding
the motoric aspects of the behavior.

72
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,476
Your brain tells your spine,
tells your muscles

73
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,756
to do something or other,

74
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,716
and hooray, you've behaved.

75
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,396
What's hard is understanding
the meaning of the behavior,

76
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,236
because in some settings,
pulling a trigger is an appalling act;

77
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,236
in others, it's heroically
self-sacrificial.

78
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,196
In some settings, putting your hand
one someone else's

79
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,676
is deeply compassionate.

80
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,596
In others, it's a deep betrayal.

81
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,156
The challenge is to understand

82
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,436
the biology of the context
of our behaviors,

83
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,060
and that's real tough.

84
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,036
One thing that's clear, though,
is you're not going to get anywhere

85
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,476
if you think there's going to be
the brain region or the hormone

86
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,236
or the gene or the childhood experience

87
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,340
or the evolutionary mechanism
that explains everything.

88
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,980
Instead, every bit of behavior
has multiple levels of causality.

89
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,020
Let's look at an example.

90
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,860
You have a gun.

91
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,116
There's a crisis going on:

92
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,716
rioting, violence, people running around.

93
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,916
A stranger is running at you
in an agitated state --

94
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,036
you can't quite tell if the expression
is frightened, threatening, angry --

95
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,276
holding something
that kind of looks like a handgun.

96
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,516
You're not sure.

97
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,436
The stranger comes running at you

98
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,196
and you pull the trigger.

99
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,156
And it turns out
that thing in this person's hand

100
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,380
was a cell phone.

101
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,236
So we asked this biological question:

102
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,436
what was going on
that caused this behavior?

103
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,356
What caused this behavior?

104
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,676
And this is a multitude of questions.

105
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,916
We start.

106
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,356
What was going on in your brain
one second before you pulled that trigger?

107
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,076
And this brings us into the realm
of a brain region called the amygdala.

108
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,036
The amygdala, which is
central to violence, central to fear,

109
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,756
initiates volleys of cascades

110
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,036
that produce pulling of a trigger.

111
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,740
What was the level of activity
in your amygdala one second before?

112
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,076
But to understand that,
we have to step back a little bit.

113
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,676
What was going on in the environment
seconds to minutes before

114
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,436
that impacted the amygdala?

115
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,556
Now, obviously, the sights,
the sounds of the rioting,

116
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,796
that was pertinent.

117
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,036
But in addition,

118
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,516
you're more likely to mistake
a cell phone for a handgun

119
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,796
if that stranger was male

120
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,420
and large and of a different race.

121
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,316
Furthermore, if you're in pain,

122
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,516
if you're hungry, if you're exhausted,

123
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,076
your frontal cortex
is not going to work as well,

124
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,756
part of the brain whose job it is
to get to the amygdala in time

125
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,060
saying, "Are you really sure
that's a gun there?"

126
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,756
But we need to step further back.

127
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,956
Now we have to look
at hours to days before,

128
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,956
and with this, we have entered
the realm of hormones.

129
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,116
For example, testosterone,

130
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,876
where regardless of your sex,

131
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,756
if you have elevated
testosterone levels in your blood,

132
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,156
you're more likely to think
a face with a neutral expression

133
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,236
is instead looking threatening.

134
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,116
Elevated testosterone levels,
elevated levels of stress hormones,

135
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,436
and your amygdala
is going to be more active

136
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,940
and your frontal cortex
will be more sluggish.

137
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,876
Pushing back further,
weeks to months before,

138
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,356
where's the relevance there?

139
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,916
This is the realm of neural plasticity,

140
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,876
the fact that your brain
can change in response to experience,

141
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,076
and if your previous months
have been filled with stress and trauma,

142
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,956
your amygdala will have enlarged.

143
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,196
The neurons will have become
more excitable,

144
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,556
your frontal cortex would have atrophied,

145
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,380
all relevant to what happens
in that one second.

146
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,796
But we push back even more, back years,

147
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,316
back, for example, to your adolescence.

148
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,836
Now, the central fact
of the adolescent brain

149
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,596
is all of it is going full blast

150
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,316
except the frontal cortex,

151
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,076
which is still half-baked.

152
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,276
It doesn't fully mature
until you're around 25.

153
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,516
And thus, adolescence and early adulthood

154
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,676
are the years where environment
and experience sculpt your frontal cortex

155
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,500
into the version you're going to have
as an adult in that critical moment.

156
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,396
But pushing back even further,

157
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,876
even further back
to childhood and fetal life

158
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,716
and all the different versions
that that could come in.

159
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,996
Now, obviously, that's the time
that your brain is being constructed,

160
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,236
and that's important,

161
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,556
but in addition,
experience during those times

162
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,556
produce what are called
epigenetic changes,

163
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,236
permanent, in some cases,

164
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,596
permanently activating
certain genes, turning off others.

165
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,116
And as an example of this,

166
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,156
if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot
of stress hormones through your mother,

167
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,596
epigenetics is going to produce
your amygdala in adulthood

168
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,556
as a more excitable form,

169
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,220
and you're going to have
elevated stress hormone levels.

170
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,676
But pushing even further back,

171
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,396
back to when you were just a fetus,

172
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,236
back to when all you were
was a collection of genes.

173
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,636
Now, genes are really
important to all of this,

174
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,396
but critically, genes don't
determine anything,

175
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,060
because genes work differently
in different environments.

176
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,716
Key example here:

177
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,876
there's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,

178
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,556
and if you have that variant,

179
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,236
you are far more likely
to commit antisocial violence

180
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,236
if, and only if,
you were abused as a child.

181
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,636
Genes and environment interact,

182
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,275
and what's happening in that one second
before you pull that trigger

183
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:45,540
reflects your lifetime
of those gene-environment interactions.

184
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:50,116
Now, remarkably enough,
we've got to push even further back now,

185
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,516
back centuries.

186
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,876
What were your ancestors up to.

187
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,076
And if, for example,
they were nomadic pastoralists,

188
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,356
they were pastoralists,

189
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,956
people living in deserts or grasslands

190
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,636
with their herds of camels, cows, goats,

191
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,716
odds are they would have invented
what's called a culture of honor

192
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,956
filled with warrior classes,

193
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,676
retributive violence, clan vendettas,

194
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,956
and amazingly, centuries later,

195
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,660
that would still be influencing
the values with which you were raised.

196
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,756
But we've got to push even further back,

197
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,516
back millions of years,

198
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,596
because if we're talking about genes,

199
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,276
implicitly we're now talking
about the evolution of genes.

200
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,516
And what you see is, for example,

201
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,036
patterns across different primate species.

202
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,476
Some of them have evolved
for extremely low levels of aggression,

203
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,036
others have evolved
in the opposite direction,

204
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,956
and floating there in between
by every measure are humans,

205
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,876
once again this confused,
barely defined species

206
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,140
that has all these potentials
to go one way or the other.

207
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,196
So what has this gotten us to?

208
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,196
Basically, what we're seeing here is,

209
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,116
if you want to understand a behavior,

210
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,996
whether it's an appalling one,
a wondrous one,

211
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,756
or confusedly in between,

212
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,316
if you want to understand that,

213
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,796
you've got take into account
what happened a second before

214
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,276
to a million years before,

215
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,956
everything in between.

216
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,956
So what can we conclude at this point?

217
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,276
Officially, it's complicated.

218
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,916
Wow, that's really helpful.

219
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,196
It's complicated,

220
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,796
and you'd better be
real careful, real cautious

221
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,156
before you conclude
you know what causes a behavior,

222
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,940
especially if it's a behavior
you're judging harshly.

223
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,396
Now, to me, the single most important
point about all of this

224
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,796
is one having to do with change.

225
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:43,196
Every bit of biology I have mentioned here
can change in different circumstances.

226
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,036
For example, ecosystems change.

227
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,476
Thousands of years ago,
the Sahara was a lush grassland.

228
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,116
Cultures change.

229
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,476
In the 17th century, the most terrifying
people in Europe were the Swedes,

230
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,236
rampaging all over the place.

231
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,436
This is what the Swedish
military does now.

232
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,300
They haven't had a war in 200 years.

233
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,556
Most importantly,

234
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,196
brains change.

235
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,236
Neurons grow new processes.

236
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,716
Circuits disconnect.

237
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,396
Everything in the brain changes,

238
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,620
and out of this come extraordinary
examples of human change.

239
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,836
First one:

240
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,556
this is a man named John Newton,

241
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,916
a British theologian

242
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,676
who played a central role in the abolition
of slavery from the British Empire

243
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,716
in the early 1800s.

244
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,476
And amazingly, this man
spent decades as a younger man

245
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,636
as the captain of a slave ship,

246
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,596
and then as an investor in slavery,

247
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,756
growing rich from this.

248
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,436
And then something changed.

249
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,996
Something changed in him,

250
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,276
something that Newton himself celebrated
in the thing that he's most famous for,

251
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,916
a hymn that he wrote:

252
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,340
"Amazing Grace."

253
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,756
This is a man named Zenji Abe
on the morning of December 6, 1941,

254
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,756
about to lead a squadron of Japanese
bombers to attack Pearl Harbor.

255
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,316
And this is the same man
50 years later to the day

256
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,916
hugging a man who survived
the attack on the ground.

257
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,356
And as an old man,

258
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,796
Zenji Abe came to a collection
of Pearl Harbor survivors

259
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,236
at a ceremony there

260
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,580
and in halting English apologized
for what he had done as a young man.

261
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,476
Now, it doesn't always require decades.

262
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,196
Sometimes, extraordinary change
could happen in just hours.

263
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,596
Consider the World War I
Christmas truce of 1914.

264
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,756
The powers that be
had negotiated a brief truce

265
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,396
so that soldiers could go out,

266
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,316
collect bodies from no-man's-land
in between the trench lines.

267
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,276
And soon British and German soldiers

268
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,756
were doing that,

269
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,236
and then helping each other carry bodies,

270
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,916
and then helping each other
dig graves in the frozen ground,

271
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,196
and then praying together,

272
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,036
and then having Christmas together
and exchanging gifts,

273
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,276
and by the next day,
they were playing soccer together

274
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,676
and exchanging addresses
so they could meet after the war.

275
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,676
That truce kept going
until the officers had to arrive

276
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,196
and said, "We will shoot you

277
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,716
unless you go back
to trying to kill each other."

278
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,876
And all it took here was hours

279
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,236
for these men to develop
a completely new category of "us,"

280
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,156
all of us in the trenches here

281
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,956
on both sides, dying for no damn reason,

282
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,636
and who is a "them,"
those faceless powers behind the lines

283
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,260
who were using them as pawns.

284
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,700
And sometimes,
change can occur in seconds.

285
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,876
Probably the most horrifying event
in the Vietnam War

286
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,796
was the My Lai Massacre.

287
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,836
A brigade of American soldiers

288
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,876
went into an undefended
village full of civilians

289
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,436
and killed between 350 and 500 of them,

290
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,316
mass-raped women and children,

291
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,916
mutilated bodies.

292
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,156
It was appalling.

293
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,436
It was appalling because it occurred,
because the government denied it,

294
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,836
because the US government eventually
did nothing more than a slap on the wrist,

295
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,116
and appalling because it almost certainly
was not a singular event.

296
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,236
This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man
who stopped the My Lai Massacre.

297
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,876
He was piloting a helicopter gunship,

298
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,716
landed there, got out

299
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,796
and saw American soldiers shooting babies,

300
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,196
shooting old women,

301
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,116
figured out what was going on,

302
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,236
and he then took his helicopter

303
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,236
and did something that undid
his lifetime of conditioning

304
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,316
as to who is an "us" and who is a "them."

305
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,196
He landed his helicopter

306
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,836
in between some surviving villagers
and American soldiers

307
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,516
and he trained his machine guns
on his fellow Americans,

308
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,420
and said, "If you don't stop the killing,
I will mow you down."

309
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,356
Now, these people
are no more special than any of us.

310
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,956
Same neurons, same neurochemicals,

311
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,300
same biology.

312
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,596
What we're left with here
is this inevitable cliche:

313
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,356
"Those who don't study history
are destined to repeat it."

314
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,556
What we have here is the opposite of it.

315
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,836
Those who don't study the history
of extraordinary human change,

316
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,396
those who don't study the biology
of what can transform us

317
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,916
from our worst to our best behaviors,

318
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,996
those who don't do this
are destined not to be able

319
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,900
to repeat these incandescent,
magnificent moments.

320
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,500
So thank you.

321
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,940
(Applause)

322
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,356
CA: Talks that really give you
a new mental model about something,

323
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,316
those are some of my favorite TED Talks,

324
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,060
and we just got one.

325
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,636
Robert, thank you so much for that.
Good luck with the book.

326
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,916
That was amazing,

327
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,116
and we're going to try and get you
to come here in person one year.

328
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,356
Thank you so much.

329
00:15:48,380 --> 00:00:00,000
RS: Thank you. Thank you all.
