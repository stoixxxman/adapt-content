1
00:00:05.0 --> 00:00:08.200
Look at that.
Another new coffee shop.

2
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.910
- You see that?
- Totally. Yeah.

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.840
- What's that one called?
- Foam Party.

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.580
"Foam Party"? Come on.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.950
And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that?

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.110
I see it.

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.620
Is that a coffee shop
or a disco?

8
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.320
Dad, you're old, man.

9
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.120

this guy swings in once a day,

13
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.900
zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.60
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

15
00:00:34.70 --> 00:00:35.570
Meanwhile,
my guys are out there,

16
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.0
- lives on the line, no masks.
- Uh-huh.

17
00:00:38.0 --> 00:00:40.970
- We show our faces.
- Speed up. I know these kids.

18
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.970

comes great accountability.

19

20
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.110
I do like his cereal, though.
I'll give him that.

21
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.380
Oh, my gosh.
Don't cops run red lights?

22
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.210
Oh, yeah, some do.
But not your dad.

I just think that

30

- And I would prefer to be

He's a good guy.
