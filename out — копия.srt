1
00:00:05.0 --> 00:00:08.200
Look at that.
Another new coffee shop.

2
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.910
- You see that?
- Totally. Yeah.

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.840
- What's that one called?
- Foam Party.

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.580
"Foam Party"? Come on.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.950
And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that?

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.110
I see it.

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.620
Is that a coffee shop
or a disco?

8
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.320
Dad, you're old, man.

9
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.120
<i>There are multiple reports</i>

10
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.20
<i>of another mysterious
seismic event last night.</i>

11
00:00:25.20 --> 00:00:26.990
<i>Sources close to Spider-Man say
he's looking into the problem.</i>

12
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.460
Spider-Man. I mean,
this guy swings in once a day,

13
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.900
zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.60
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

15
00:00:34.70 --> 00:00:35.570
Meanwhile,
my guys are out there,

16
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.0
- lives on the line, no masks.
- Uh-huh.

17
00:00:38.0 --> 00:00:40.970
- We show our faces.
- Speed up. I know these kids.

18
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.970
With great ability
comes great accountability.

19
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.570
That's not even
how the saying goes.

20
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.110
I do like his cereal, though.
I'll give him that.

21
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.380
Oh, my gosh.
Don't cops run red lights?

22
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.210
Oh, yeah, some do.
But not your dad.

23
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.220
<i>♪ My memories keep begging ♪</i>

24
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.450
<i>♪ For someone else ♪</i>

25
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.160
<i>♪ I know this feeling, yes
I know it very well ♪</i>

26
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.230
Why can't I go back
to Brooklyn Middle?

27
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.630
You've given it
two weeks.

28
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.400
We're not having
this conversation.

29
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.600
I just think that
this new school is elitist.

30
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.200
- "Elitist"?
- And I would prefer to be

31
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.0
at a normal school
among the people.

32
00:01:14.10 --> 00:01:15.940
"The people"?
These are your people.

33
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.380
I'm only here 'cause
I won that stupid lottery.

34
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.110
No way. You passed the entry
test just like everybody else.

35
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.680
You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that?

36
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.380
You wanna end up
like your uncle?

37
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.450
What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.

38
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.20
We all make choices in life.

39
00:01:30.20 --> 00:01:31.550
It doesn't feel
like I have a choice right now.

40
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.990
You don't!

41
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.570
I love you, Miles.

42
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.480
Yeah, I know, Dad.
See you Friday.

43
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.210
- You gotta say "I love you" back.
- Dad, are you serious?

44
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.350
I wanna hear it.
"I love you, Dad."

45
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.20
You wanna hear me
say it?

46
00:02:00.20 --> 00:02:01.380
You're dropping me off
at a school.

47
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.580
- "I love you, Dad."
- Look at this place.

48
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.590
"Dad, I love you."

49
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.330
Dad, I love you.

50
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.550
That's a copy.
